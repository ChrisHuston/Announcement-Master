Announcement Master
======
**Announcement Master** is an LTI app developed for use with the Canvas LMS. Send announcements to select sections (or all sections) across one or more Canvas courses. Courses do not need to be cross-listed. The announcements persist in Canvas so students will see them in Canvas along with an immediate email with the announcement. Canvas's notification preferences do not affect these announcements. Thus, even if students have turned off receiving email notifications from Canvas announcements, they will still receive an email.

Option to include images, videos and files in the announcement. These uploaded files will not exist in the Canvas course Files section.
